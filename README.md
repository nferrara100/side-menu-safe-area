# Demo of how to use safe areas with react-native-side-menu

Side menu currently does not support them, which means it causes styling problems on
newer iPhones. Follow the commit history to see how I fixed that here, using my fork of
the `react-native-side-menu`.

# Build hack
I couldn't figure out how to build side menu properly so this demo depends on a hack
outside of the pull request to get it built. The master branch has the hack, while
branch pull-request does not. pull-request should still work once someone else builds
it right. If you know more about how it is supposed to be built please correct me.
